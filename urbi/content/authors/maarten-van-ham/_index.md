My research focusses on two major themes. The first theme is better understanding urban and spatial inequalities and the dynamics of these inequalities over time. The second related theme is better understanding the effects of these spatial inequalities on the behavior and outcomes of people. Many of the contemporary spatial inequalities in cities are strongly rooted in urban planning and urban design decisions of the past. My research is therefore highly relevant for informing future urban design decisions. The focus of my research is on socio-economic segregation in an international comparative perspective. To better understand segregation I apply an innovative multi-scalar framework to measure the spatial context of people, and alternative measures of segregation such as social frontiers.
