Ignacio is a researcher from Chile and currently a Ph.D. candidate in Urban Studies at the Department of Urbanism at TU Delft. His work explores the spatio-temporal evolution of sociospatial inequalities using administrative microdata from the Netherlands, with a focus on integrating multivariate, multiscalar and longitudinal methods. His research interests include urban segregation, neighbourhood effects, labour markets and geographic data science.

He began his academic career as a research assistant on projects related to housing markets, segregation, and labour dynamics. He then worked at the Chilean Ministry of Social Development, where he coordinated a team focused on developing geospatial indicators to inform social policy and benefit allocation. That experience reinforced his interest in spatial inequalities and led him back into academia. He holds a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Economics from the University of Chile and an M.Sc. in Human Geography from Utrecht University.
