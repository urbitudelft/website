I am a researcher from Chile and currently a Ph.D. candidate in Urban Studies at the Department of Urbanism at TU Delft. My work explores the spatio-temporal evolution of sociospatial inequalities using administrative microdata from the Netherlands. In particular, my research focuses on integrating multivariate, multiscalar and longitudinal methods to better undertand the causes, patterns and consequences of urban inequalities. I am also interested in the role of time and space in the analysis of social stratification and how these concepts can be operationalized in urban analytics.

I began my academic career as a research assistant on projects related to housing markets, segregation, and labour dynamics. I then worked at the Chilean Ministry of Social Development, where I coordinated a team focused on developing geospatial indicators to inform social policy and benefit allocation. That experience reinforced my interest in spatial inequalities and led me back into academia. I hold a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Economics from the University of Chile and an M.Sc. in Human Geography from Utrecht University.
