I am an Urban Geographer, focussing on sociospatial inequalities, segregation, and spatial context effects – how neighbourhoods at various spatial scales, cities, and regions influence individual life course outcomes. I analyse large and complex population data using large-scale computing infrastructures to contribute knowledge leading to better urban design and social policies. To do so, I developed a novel methodology to create multiscale measures of population using individual level register data from Statistics Netherlands (CBS). My main aim is to enhance the quality of life in urban environments. 

Through my work in inclusive cartography and tactile mapping, my goal is to make scientific knowledge more accessible, understandable and attractive to both sighted and visually impaired people.
